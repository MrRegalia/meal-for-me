# Meal For Me

Meal For Me is a web based meal planner that makes it easy to plan meals during the course of the week.
We created this app because we had the need to plan our meals in an easy way.
Because of Meal For Me we will have an overview of what meals will be cooked/eaten on what day.
As our requirements change at home we will keep this app updated with new features.

## How to use Meal For Me

For now the app isn't up and running yet.
We plan to build a web based interface where you can log-in through Google and Facebook.
After logging in you will be able to use the app.
